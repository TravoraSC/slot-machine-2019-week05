This is a slot machine with 3 reels and 5 numbers on each one. I added a bit of a mystical element to make it more fun for me. 
I made it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned how to animate text shadow to create a glowing effect on my text. I got to practice looping with JavaScript, and I hope to add some features with a bit more time, like a way for the player to win.

I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4
